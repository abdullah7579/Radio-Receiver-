Designed and implemented an FM radio receiver capable of capturing and converting modulated frequencies into audible signals. The project featured a cost-effective and practical approach using essential circuit elements such as antennas, transistors, op-amps, and an RLC circuit for frequency filtering and amplification. 

Key components included:
Tuner Circuit: Selected specific radio frequencies.
Amplification Stage: Utilized 2N3904 transistors and TL082 op-amp for signal amplification.
Filter Circuit: Suppressed unwanted frequencies with an RLC series filter.
Audio Output: Delivered sound through a 5W speaker.
The design achieved an experimental frequency of 88.4 MHz, closely matching the calculated 87.6 MHz, with minor discrepancies attributed to component tolerances. Future improvements include precise components, digital tuning, and advanced signal processing for enhanced performance.
